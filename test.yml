Discovery Essay Reflection

                Looking back at my essay, “The Brother, Son, and Engineer,” I realize that I used a lot of emotional drive in my intro and first few body paragraphs. Now reflecting back on this, I noticed that as I began to stray from the thesis, checking off each key topic as I wrote each paragraph, I began to express myself less. I poured my thoughts into the initial body paragraphs but began to become more methodical as I went on. This is most likely due to losing my emotional drive as I reached the end.

               Nonetheless, I discovered that writing my thoughts proved to be cathartic. I was able to release my emotions into and reflect on my life experiences simultaneously. When I first sat down to write the ‘Discovery’ essay, I was first motivated to detail every single aspect of my past and upbringing. However, I stopped myself and considered the audience’s perspective. If the audience read every detail of my past, it would be tedious and strenuous. Not only that, but the reader would also be mentally exhausted from processing all these details to understand the essay and its main themes. So, in the end, I opted for a more summarized version of my original draft, which I admit was bland in some respects because of the condensing.

               Regarding detail, I want to specify that some of my paragraphs may have sounded monotone from lack of specificity. Although this might be the case, I found it to be a relatively quicker and enjoyable read. Theres a lot of positives and negatives weighing out the essay overall, so I will say that if the audience was looking for a quick summary of who I am and my upbringing, then the essay was perfect in that regard.

               I want to delve into who the target audience was in my essay. As I wrote, I had to keep in mind that my target audience wasn’t just the Professor, but rather a group of people interested in reading about my past. I found that when I wrote for a broader audience, my writing became more inclusive and captivating, as it did not target one specific person. Keeping the target audience in mind made writing my thoughts down easier, as it broadened the range of thoughts that felt more appropriate to write.

               In conclusion, writing my essay was a very fun, cathartic, and learning experience. I will try to improve in filtering my thoughts and emotions for personal essays. Additionally, I need to keep in my target audience and demographic; who is reading my essay and who would be interested in it? I believe that if I understand the difference between a personal and professional essay, the objectives I personally set for the essay, and the purpose of the essay, I will be able to navigate between the lines and offer a more enjoyable reading experience.
